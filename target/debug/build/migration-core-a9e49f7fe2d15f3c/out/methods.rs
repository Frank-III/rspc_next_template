pub mod json_rpc {
//! The JSON-RPC API definition.
//!
//! ## Methods
//!
//!
//! ### üîå applyMigrations

//! ‚û°Ô∏è  [ApplyMigrationsInput](./types/struct.ApplyMigrationsInput.html)
//!
//! ‚Ü©Ô∏è  [ApplyMigrationsOutput](./types/struct.ApplyMigrationsOutput.html)
//!
//! Apply the migrations from the migrations directory to the database.
//! 
//! This is the command behind `prisma migrate deploy`.
//!
//! ### üîå createDatabase

//! ‚û°Ô∏è  [CreateDatabaseParams](./types/struct.CreateDatabaseParams.html)
//!
//! ‚Ü©Ô∏è  [CreateDatabaseResult](./types/struct.CreateDatabaseResult.html)
//!
//! Create the logical database from the Prisma schema.
//!
//! ### üîå createMigration

//! ‚û°Ô∏è  [CreateMigrationInput](./types/struct.CreateMigrationInput.html)
//!
//! ‚Ü©Ô∏è  [CreateMigrationOutput](./types/struct.CreateMigrationOutput.html)
//!
//! Create the next migration in the migrations history. If `draft` is false and
//! there are no unexecutable steps, it will also apply the newly created
//! migration.
//! 
//! **Note**: This will use the shadow database on the connectors where we need
//! one.
//!
//! ### üîå dbExecute

//! ‚û°Ô∏è  [DbExecuteParams](./types/struct.DbExecuteParams.html)
//!
//! ‚Ü©Ô∏è  [DbExecuteResult](./types/struct.DbExecuteResult.html)
//!
//! Execute a database script directly on the specified live database.
//! 
//! Note that this may not be
//! defined on all connectors.
//!
//! ### üîå debugPanic

//! ‚û°Ô∏è  [DebugPanicInput](./types/struct.DebugPanicInput.html)
//!
//! ‚Ü©Ô∏è  [DebugPanicOutput](./types/struct.DebugPanicOutput.html)
//!
//! Make the migration engine panic. Only useful to test client error handling.
//!
//! ### üîå devDiagnostic

//! ‚û°Ô∏è  [DevDiagnosticInput](./types/struct.DevDiagnosticInput.html)
//!
//! ‚Ü©Ô∏è  [DevDiagnosticOutput](./types/struct.DevDiagnosticOutput.html)
//!
//! The method called at the beginning of `migrate dev` to decide the course of
//! action based on the current state of the workspace.
//! 
//! It acts as a wrapper around diagnoseMigrationHistory. Its role is to interpret
//! the diagnostic output, and translate it to a concrete action to be performed by
//! the CLI.
//!
//! ### üîå diagnoseMigrationHistory

//! ‚û°Ô∏è  [DiagnoseMigrationHistoryInput](./types/struct.DiagnoseMigrationHistoryInput.html)
//!
//! ‚Ü©Ô∏è  [DiagnoseMigrationHistoryOutput](./types/struct.DiagnoseMigrationHistoryOutput.html)
//!
//! Read the contents of the migrations directory and the migrations table,
//! and returns their relative statuses. At this stage, the migration
//! engine only reads, it does not write to the database nor the migrations
//! directory, nor does it use a shadow database.
//!
//! ### üîå diff

//! ‚û°Ô∏è  [DiffParams](./types/struct.DiffParams.html)
//!
//! ‚Ü©Ô∏è  [DiffResult](./types/struct.DiffResult.html)
//!
//! Compares two databases schemas from two arbitrary sources, and display the
//! difference as either a human-readable summary, or an executable script that can
//! be passed to dbExecute.
//! 
//! Connection to a shadow database is only necessary when either the `from` or the
//! `to` params is a migrations directory.
//! 
//! Diffs have a _direction_. Which source is `from` and which is `to` matters. The
//! resulting diff should be thought as a migration from the schema in `from` to
//! the schema in `to`.
//! 
//! By default, we output a human-readable diff. If you want an executable script,
//! pass the `"script": true` param.
//!
//! ### üîå ensureConnectionValidity

//! ‚û°Ô∏è  [EnsureConnectionValidityParams](./types/struct.EnsureConnectionValidityParams.html)
//!
//! ‚Ü©Ô∏è  [EnsureConnectionValidityResult](./types/struct.EnsureConnectionValidityResult.html)
//!
//! Make sure the migration engine can connect to the database from the Prisma schema.
//!
//! ### üîå evaluateDataLoss

//! ‚û°Ô∏è  [EvaluateDataLossInput](./types/struct.EvaluateDataLossInput.html)
//!
//! ‚Ü©Ô∏è  [EvaluateDataLossOutput](./types/struct.EvaluateDataLossOutput.html)
//!
//! Development command for migrations. Evaluate the data loss induced by the next
//! migration the engine would generate on the main database.
//! 
//! At this stage, the engine does not create or mutate anything in the database
//! nor in the migrations directory.
//! 
//! This is part of the `migrate dev` flow.
//! 
//! **Note**: the engine currently assumes the main database schema is up-to-date
//! with the migration history.
//!
//! ### üîå getDatabaseVersion

//! ‚û°Ô∏è  [GetDatabaseVersionInput](./types/struct.GetDatabaseVersionInput.html)
//!
//! ‚Ü©Ô∏è  [GetDatabaseVersionOutput](./types/struct.GetDatabaseVersionOutput.html)
//!
//! Get the database version for error reporting.
//!
//! ### üîå listMigrationDirectories

//! ‚û°Ô∏è  [ListMigrationDirectoriesInput](./types/struct.ListMigrationDirectoriesInput.html)
//!
//! ‚Ü©Ô∏è  [ListMigrationDirectoriesOutput](./types/struct.ListMigrationDirectoriesOutput.html)
//!
//! List the names of the migrations in the migrations directory.
//!
//! ### üîå markMigrationApplied

//! ‚û°Ô∏è  [MarkMigrationAppliedInput](./types/struct.MarkMigrationAppliedInput.html)
//!
//! ‚Ü©Ô∏è  [MarkMigrationAppliedOutput](./types/struct.MarkMigrationAppliedOutput.html)
//!
//! Mark a migration as applied in the migrations table.
//! 
//! There are two possible outcomes:
//! 
//! - The migration is already in the table, but in a failed state. In this case, we will mark it
//! as rolled back, then create a new entry.
//! - The migration is not in the table. We will create a new entry in the migrations table. The
//! `started_at` and `finished_at` will be the same.
//! - If it is already applied, we return a user-facing error.
//!
//! ### üîå markMigrationRolledBack

//! ‚û°Ô∏è  [MarkMigrationRolledBackInput](./types/struct.MarkMigrationRolledBackInput.html)
//!
//! ‚Ü©Ô∏è  [MarkMigrationRolledBackOutput](./types/struct.MarkMigrationRolledBackOutput.html)
//!
//! Mark an existing failed migration as rolled back in the migrations table. It
//! will still be there, but ignored for all purposes except as audit trail.
//!
//! ### üîå reset

//! ‚û°Ô∏è  [ResetInput](./types/struct.ResetInput.html)
//!
//! ‚Ü©Ô∏è  [ResetOutput](./types/struct.ResetOutput.html)
//!
//! Try to make the database empty: no data and no schema. On most connectors, this
//! is implemented by dropping and recreating the database. If that fails (most
//! likely because of insufficient permissions), the engine attemps a "best effort
//! reset" by inspecting the contents of the database and dropping them
//! individually.
//! 
//! Drop and recreate the database. The migrations will not be applied, as it would
//! overlap with `applyMigrations`.
//!
//! ### üîå schemaPush

//! ‚û°Ô∏è  [SchemaPushInput](./types/struct.SchemaPushInput.html)
//!
//! ‚Ü©Ô∏è  [SchemaPushOutput](./types/struct.SchemaPushOutput.html)
//!
//! The command behind `db push`.
/// String constants for method names.
